#README.File**Framework and Language Used:**- The project uses Java for its backend development.- It utilizes the Spring Boot framework for building web applications and provides a RESTful API.- For database operations and ORM, it uses Jakarta Persistence (JPA) with the Hibernate framework.- Lombok is used to reduce boilerplate code with annotations like `@Data`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, and `@AllArgsConstructor`.**Data Flow:**1. **Controller:**   - The `AuthenticationService` class handles user authentication and token management.   - The `PostService` class manages operations related to posts.   - The `UserService` class handles user registration, sign-in, sign-out, and updates.2. **Services:**   - `AuthenticationService` manages token creation, authentication, and deletion.   - `PostService` handles post creation and retrieval.   - `UserService` manages user registration, sign-in, sign-out, and updates.3. **Repository:**   - `IAuthenticationRepo` provides access to the AuthenticationToken entity, with methods for finding tokens by value or user.   - `IPostRepo` provides access to the Post entity for CRUD operations.   - `IUserRepo` provides access to the User entity, with a method to find a user by email.4. **Database Design:**   - The project uses a relational database with the following entities:     - `User` with fields like userId, userFirstName, userLastName, userAge, userPhoneNumber, userEmail, userPassword.     - `Post` with fields postId, createDate, updateDate, and a reference to the user who owns the post.     - `AuthenticationToken` with tokenId, tokenValue, tokenCreationDateTime, and a reference to the user associated with the token.**Data Structure Used:**- The data structure used in this project is a relational database, typically SQL-based. The project uses tables to store and manage data. Entities like `User`, `Post`, and `AuthenticationToken` are mapped to corresponding database tables, and relationships are established using foreign keys.**Project Summary:**This project is a backend system for a social media platform. It manages user registration, authentication, and post creation. It employs Spring Boot for building RESTful APIs and Jakarta Persistence with Hibernate for database operations. Users can sign up, sign in, and create posts, with password encryption and token-based authentication for security. The data is stored in a relational database, and the system provides API endpoints for these operations. The system offers various services such as user management, token management, and post management, all orchestrated through controllers.
